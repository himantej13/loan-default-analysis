# loan-default-analysis
data analysis project of loan repayment status to understand default patterns

This project involves exploratory data analysis of loan repayment status to uncover patterns and insights related to loan defaults. Using customer demographic and financial data, the analysis explores how factors like age groups and income levels impact loan repayment behavior.

The goal is to provide a clear understanding of trends and relationships in the data through visualization and summary statistics, which can help inform lending decisions.
